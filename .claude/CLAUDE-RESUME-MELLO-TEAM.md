CLAUDE RESUME - COMFY-MULTI (ASSUMES WELCOME HAS BEEN COMPLETED) 

**PHASE**: VERDA GPU INSTANCE DEPLOYMENT

## TODAY'S GOALS
                                                                              
  Today we are developing on our web app ComfyMulti - designed to    
  economically run ComfyUI for a workshop of ~20 professional filmmakers in   
  generating video with AI.

## CORE KNOWLEDGE: DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOWS                                     
                                                                              
  Mello Server                                                                
  We always run  mello  - main dev server (Hetzner VPS)                       
  This is where "Mello team" does development (Claude Code).                  
                                                                              
  For our workshop - 
     mello runs ComfyMulti frontend user containers & fast api & REDIS                                                                       
  Verda Server                                                                
  We don't always provision a verda  - instance on Verda GPU cloud                 
                                                                              
  NOTE: we can choose between GPU or CPU instances                    
  e.g. CPU instance for dev / GPU for workshop use                    
                                                                              
  But sometimes - like recently - the "Verda team" does dev on this machine.    
                                                                              
  For our workshop - we try to choose/run instances/storage on Verda          
  economically.                                                               
                                                                              
  Verda Rental:                                                               
  Verda charges rental fees even while following are stopped:                 
                                                                              
  1. Instance (on OS-BlockStorage) +                                          
  2. Models, backups/restore cache, inference worker container (SFS network   
  drive) +                                                                    
  3. Scratch (Data-BlockStorage)                                              
                                                                              
  Hence we tend to want to delete these when possible to avoid some charges:  
  Instance/OS-BlockStorage + Scratch/Data-BlockStorage                        
                                                                              
  When in regular use we keep SFS network drive (with our models+worker) so we
  don't need to D/L models from storage, and to quickly restore instance from cache.
                                                                              
  DURING 'TESTING MONTH' - or - 'WORKSHOP MONTH'                              
  We create fresh Verda disks & restore from R2:                              
  SFS (models, cache) +  
  Instance/OS-BlockStorage (fully set up, running worker).                                                                    
  We format a fresh Data-Block-Storage (scratch disk)                         
                                                                              
  Then we retain the SFS on Verda - (faster than re-downloading models etc.   
  from R2!)                                                                        
                                                                              
  But we delete the Instance & Scratch to save $$$.                           
                                                                              
  DURING 'TESTING DAYS' or 'WORKSHOP DAYS'                                    
  Our SFS is still running - no need to restore it.                           
                                                                              
  We restore our fresh instance (setup, worker etc.) from cache on SFS.       
                                                                              
  AND add a fresh Data-BlockStorage as our ephemeral scratch disk (user       
  inputs/outputs).                                                            
                                                                              
  BETWEEN TESTING / WORKSHOP PERIODS                                          
  We delete Verda instance AND Verda SFS AND Verda block storage to save $$.  
                                                                              
  BACKUPS WHILE VERDA INSTANCE IS RUNNING                                     
  Hrly cron job backs up verda instance OS volume files -> SFS volume         
                                                                              
  END OF WORKSHOP DAY 1 (PRIOR TO WORKSHOP DAY 2)                             
  We run additional backup scripts:                                           
                                                                              
  • verda disks (models, container, config) -> R2                             
  • mello files -> R2                                                         
                                                                              
  THEN: we delete Verda GPU instance END OF DAY to save highest cost GPU      
  instance $$.                                                                
                                                                              
  • but leave BOTH: SFS (models) and block storage (scratch disk) running.    
                                                                              
  NOTE: If we decide to switch to Serverless inference                        
                                                                              
  • we may choose to rent/restore to cheap Verda CPU (NOT GPU) Instance 
  • and keep it running during Workshop periods (less backup/restore)         
  • IN WHICH CASE we could explore slightly different Verda disk configurations

## DEV TEAM COORDINATION - VIA GH TRACKER
We have had another team - Verda Team - developing on the Verda server recently.
We may consolidate now to Mello Team only - but if parallel developing check:
**Channel:** https://github.com/ahelme/comfyume/issues/7

## NEXT STEPS

  Please now:

 - CHECK today's date

 - read IN FULL:

    - `./CLAUDE.md` - OUR custom deployment on Hetzner / Verda GPU Cloud

  - read top ~450 lines:
    - `.claude/progress-mello-dev.md` - progress log

  - perform git status & check commit history
    - REPORT: any pending commits/pushes ?
    - REPORT: was progress-mello-dev.md up to date?

  - read list of implementation phases (phased dev plan)
    - **READ lines: 21-35 ONLY**: `./implementation-backup-restore.md`
    - CURRENT PHASE: | **Phase 11** | Test Single GPU Instance (Restore & Verify) 
    - NOTE: context within overall plan

  - read .env (IN FULL) to FAST DOWNLOAD of key tech & config

  - discuss plan for next work with user!
