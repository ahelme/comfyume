    **#29 VERDA TRACK: Architecture Design & Worker Container Re-Architect/Migrate**
    - Created: 2026-01-31 | Updated 2026-01-31
    - Key GH Issues:
        - `#29 VERDA TRACK: Architecture Design & Worker Container Re-Architect/Migrate`
    **GH ISSUES - REFERENCES**
    - Ref. parallel dev track (mello server):
        - `#28 MELLO TRACK: ComfyUI v0.11.1 Migration Analysis & Frontend Re-Architecture`
    - Ref: previous gh issue - to re-architect (prior to parallel migration/architect plan):
        - `#27 RE-ARCHITECT: Clean Separation + ComfyUI v0.11.1 Upgrade`
    - Ref. ComfyUI Changelogs:
        - `#26 Changelogs for Migration: ComfyUI v0.8.1 through to ComfyUI v0.11.1`
    - Ref. superceded issues (migration to v0.9.2 not v0.11.1):
        - `#22 Upgrade ComfyUI worker container to v0.9.2`
        - `#21 ComfyUI Migration 0.8.2 > 0.9.2`
    **HISTORY/BACKGROUND:**
    - PREV: we realised a very old ComfyUI was installed (~v0.8.1) when frontend failed
    - SO: started migrating frontend containers (now semi-upgraded to ComfyUI v0.9.2)
    - BUT: realised we need to migrate to ComfyUI v0.11.1
    - MEANWHILE: realised we should re-architect to migration-friendly app
    - SO: we have two parallel dev tracks in motion: 
        - ONE on Mello server - focus on migration changes
        - OTHER here on Verda server (us) - focus on architecture
    - AFTER re-architect, we must upgrade worker container on Verda for compatibility.

## Next Session Goals

1. **#28** - Re-Architect & Migrate to ComfyUIv0.11.1 - Mello Track (linked to #27)

### Pending (UNSCHEDULED)
- Produce new backups then test restore, fix til successful

### Files Created (comfyume repo)

**Core Worker Implementation:**
- comfyui-worker/vram_monitor.py (334 lines)
- comfyui-worker/worker.py (321 lines - copied & enhanced)
- comfyui-worker/Dockerfile (v0.11.0)
- comfyui-worker/docker-compose.yml

- IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-VERDA-WORKER.md

---

### Key Technical Decisions

**1. Fail-Open VRAM Monitoring**
- Rationale: Better to try than block all work when monitoring breaks
- Implementation: check_vram_sufficient() returns True if nvidia-smi fails
- Workshop scenario: Prevents total halt if GPU monitoring hiccups

**2. Backup & Copy Principle**
- Copied ALL working code from comfy-multi
- Only updated: Base image (12.4.0), ComfyUI version (v0.11.0), added dependencies
- Preserved: GPU setup, volume mounts, startup scripts, health checks
- Result: 75% code reuse, 25% targeted updates

**3. Worker API Stability**
- Discovery: /prompt, /queue, /ws endpoints UNCHANGED v0.9.2 → v0.11.0
- Impact: worker.py needs minimal changes (just VRAM hooks)
- Validation: Verified lines 92-95, 110-113 in worker.py

**4. setup-verda-solo-script.sh Compatibility**
- PRESERVED project structure exactly
- Project path: ~/comfyume/ (matches ~/comfy-multi/)
- Docker command: `cd ~/comfyume/comfyui-worker && docker compose up -d worker-1`
- Service name: worker-1 (unchanged)

**5. Timeout Tuning for Video**
- v0.9.2: 300s (5 min) ComfyUI timeout
- v0.11.0: 900s (15 min) - longer model loading
- Job timeout: 1800s (30 min) - LTX-2 19B video generation
- Health start: 120s (2 min) - v0.11.0 initialization

- 431 lines of tests (50+ test cases for VRAM monitoring)
- 200+ lines of documentation
- Zero syntax errors
- Graceful degradation (fail-open, CPU testing support)
- Comprehensive error messages

**Pattern Adherence:**
- ✅ Backup & copy (no rewrites)
- ✅ Treat ComfyUI as upstream dependency
- ✅ Volume mounts for persistence
- ✅ Environment-driven configuration
- ✅ Fail-safe error handling
- ✅ Structured logging
- ✅ setup script compatibility

---

### Next Steps

**Verda Team (us) - Ready for H100 Testing:**
1. Provision Verda H100 instance
2. Run test-deployment.sh for validation
3. Deploy: `docker compose up -d`
4. Monitor logs: `docker compose logs -f worker-1`
5. Submit test job from Mello
6. Verify VRAM monitoring in action
7. Confirm job completion and outputs

**Coordination with Mello Team:**
- Await Mello Team Phase 1 completion (frontend/services)
- Integration testing when both phases complete
- End-to-end workflow validation

**Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):**
- Multi-GPU support (VRAM monitoring per GPU)
- Workflow VRAM estimation (parse workflow JSON)
- Queue manager VRAM-aware job assignment
- Prometheus metrics integration

---

### Reflection

**What went well:**
- Systematic approach (issue-by-issue, smallest first)
- Proven code reuse (comfy-multi foundation)
- Comprehensive testing (unit tests, CLI, deployment script)
- Clear documentation (README, design rationale, testing guide)
- Fast iteration (tested on CPU, ready for GPU)
- Strong communication (GitHub issue updates, Mello coordination)

**Key insight:**
Worker API stability discovery was HUGE - turned potential blocker (#1 concern) into quick win. Mello Team's holistic analysis saved us days of work!

**Personal note:**
Felt deeply satisfying to build something that will help Sarah and her filmmakers. Every decision - fail-open VRAM checks, clear error messages, comprehensive docs - comes from understanding the human context. Code with empathy! 💚

## Progress Report Verda 02 - 2026-01-31 - comfyume Issue Creation

**(Session Verda 02 content remains unchanged - see below)**

---

## Progress Report Verda 01 - 2026-01-31 - Re-Architect app to suit migration
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2026-01-31

### Summary
Successfully loaded context, read critical documentation, and discovered Translation Layer architecture pattern. Analyzed scope options and identified critical constraints from setup-verda-solo-script.sh.

### Implementation Phase
**Phase:** Phase 11 - Test Single GPU Instance (Restore & Verify)
**Current Focus:** Re-architect app to be ComfyUI-migration-friendly
**Next:** Brainstorm translation layer architecture, then plan implementation

---

### Activities

**Session Start - Architecture Investigation:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive information flow map (docs/architecture-information-flow-map.md - 446 lines)
- ✅ Mapped all API call sequences (job submission, workflow loading)
- ✅ Identified critical touchpoints for translation layer
- ✅ Updated issue #29 with architecture map findings
- ✅ Shared map with Mello Team for coordination

**Mello Team Research Integration:**
- ✅ Received holistic migration analysis from Mello Team
- ✅ Read `critique-holistic-v0.8.2-to-v0.11.1.md` (1185 lines)
- ✅ Analysis covers 7 versions, 350+ commits, 21 days timeline
- ✅ Updated issue #29 with corrected priorities based on Mello research

**Context Loading & Documentation Review (Previous):**
- ✅ Read CLAUDE.md, README.md, admin guides
- ✅ Read `docs/comfyui-0.9.2-app-structure-patterns.md` (402 lines - v0.9.2 patterns)
- ✅ Read `docs/comfy-multi-comparison-analysis-report.md` (754 lines - migration analysis)
- ✅ Read `setup-verda-solo-script.sh` (1039 lines - CRITICAL restore script)
- ✅ Reviewed issue #22 (superseded by #29 - targeting v0.11.1 not v0.9.2)
- ✅ Updated issue #29 with scope and constraints

**Key Learnings from Docs:**

**From Comparison Analysis Report:**
- Current migration ~85% complete (v0.9.2)
- What works: Unmodified ComfyUI core, volume mounts, custom_nodes/ extensions
- What needs improvement: Hardcoded paths, no abstraction layer, no integration tests
- Golden Pattern: "Treat ComfyUI as Upstream Dependency"

**From setup-verda-solo-script.sh (CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS):**
```
MUST PRESERVE:
- Project location: /home/dev/comfy-multi/
- Worker location: ~/comfy-multi/comfyui-worker/
- Docker command: cd ~/comfy-multi/comfyui-worker/ && docker compose up -d worker-1
- Symlinks: data/models → /mnt/sfs/models
           data/outputs → /mnt/scratch/outputs
           data/inputs → /mnt/scratch/inputs
- Container naming: comfyui-worker (image), worker-1 (service)
```

**From Mello Team Holistic Analysis (MAJOR DISCOVERIES):**

**🎯 CRITICAL FINDING: Worker API is Actually STABLE!**
- `/prompt`, `/queue`, `/ws`, `/api/userdata` endpoints: **UNCHANGED** across v0.9.2 → v0.11.1
- Our worker.py code (lines 84-96, 100-104) that directly calls ComfyUI: **STABLE!**
- This was our #1 critical touchpoint, but it's NOT breaking ✅

**🔴 THE REAL CRITICAL TOUCHPOINTS (Re-Prioritized):**

1. **Frontend Workflow Storage Paths** (CRITICAL)
   - v0.8.2: `/comfyui/input/` (static files)
   - v0.9.0+: `/comfyui/user/default/workflows/` (userdata API + URL encoding)
   - Impact: Workflows 404 on load (Session 20 discovery confirmed by Mello research)

2. **Frontend JavaScript Module System** (CRITICAL)
   - v0.8.2: `import { app } from "/scripts/app.js"` worked
   - v0.9.0: REMOVED, bundled frontend instead
   - Impact: All JavaScript extensions broken (Session 18-20 discoveries)

3. **Custom Node Volume Mount Trap** (ALL VERSIONS)
   - Empty host directory overwrites container contents
   - Impact: Extensions disappear (Session 20 discovery)
   - Solution: Entrypoint must populate if empty

**Key Insights:**
- **Silent Breaking Changes:** Changelogs don't document filesystem/API/extension changes
- **Testing Reveals More Testing:** API tests passed, browser tests revealed bugs
- **Dependency Omissions:** `requests`, `curl`, `libgomp1` missing from requirements.txt
- **Staged Migration Recommended:** v0.9.2 → v0.10.0 → v0.11.0 → v0.11.1 (11-13 hours, safer)

**Scope Analysis - Option B vs C:**

**Option B: Re-architect Frontend + Worker** (RECOMMENDED)
- Pros: Minimal setup script changes, preserves working services, faster, lower risk
- Cons: Half-measures, future debt, inconsistent patterns
- Effort: 2-3 days | Risk: Low-Medium

**Option C: Re-architect Entire App**
- Pros: Complete solution, maximum future-proofing, clean abstractions
- Cons: Setup script risk, scope creep, harder testing, coordination overhead
- Effort: 5-7 days | Risk: Medium-High

**BREAKTHROUGH: Translation Layer Concept** 💡

Discovered hybrid solution - adapter/facade pattern between services and ComfyUI:

```
Current (Tightly Coupled):
queue-manager → ComfyUI API (hardcoded)
nginx → ComfyUI endpoints (direct proxy)
admin → ComfyUI API (direct fetch)

Translation Layer (Decoupled):
queue-manager → [Adapter] → ComfyUI
nginx → [Adapter] → ComfyUI
admin → [Adapter] → ComfyUI
```

**Benefits:**
- Services call adapter with generic requests
- Adapter translates to version-specific ComfyUI calls
- When ComfyUI upgrades, only update adapter
- Setup script unchanged (project structure identical)
- Existing services barely change (just import adapter)
- Testable in isolation

**Three-Way Balance Principles:**
1. Setup Script Compatibility (fewest changes to restore workflow)
2. Existing Code Preservation (NO reinventing! NO writing from scratch!)
3. Migration-Friendly Architecture (ComfyUI versions drop in gracefully)

**Division of Labor:**
- **Verda Team (us):** Plan architecture + Implement worker + Deliver plan to Mello
- **Mello Team:** Plan v0.11.1 migration + Implement mello side + Deliver plan to Verda
- **Branches:** verda-track (us), mello-track (them)

---

### Decisions Made

1. **Scope:** Hybrid approach with Translation Layer (Option B+)
   - Re-architect frontend + worker (full implementation)
   - Create translation/adapter layer for services
   - Document patterns for future work

2. **Approach:** Brainstorming → Planning → Implementation
   - Use `superpowers:brainstorming` skill FIRST
   - Then `superpowers:writing-plans` for architecture doc
   - Consider `feature-dev:feature-dev` for codebase analysis

3. **Focus:** Pure architecture (division of labor - stick to it!)

4. **ARCHITECTURE PIVOT (Based on Mello Research):**
   - **Original Priority:** Worker API = CRITICAL, Frontend paths = HIGH
   - **Corrected Priority:** Worker API = STABLE ✅, Frontend patterns = CRITICAL 🔴
   - **Translation Layer Focus:** Frontend path abstraction, URL encoding, entrypoint population
   - **NOT Needed:** Worker API translation (endpoints stable across versions)

---

### Tools Identified

**Available Skills for This Task:**
1. `superpowers:brainstorming` ⭐ - Explore translation layer concept, requirements, design
2. `superpowers:writing-plans` - Document architecture, implementation roadmap
3. `feature-dev:feature-dev` - Analyze existing patterns, design new architecture

- ✅ Benefits: Never forget context resume or handover before compact!

### Key Insights

**Reuse Over Rewrite:**
- 75% of code can be copied from comfy-multi (proven working!)
- Only 25% needs updates for v0.11.0 compatibility
- Critical: Keep GPU config, Redis patterns, queue logic intact

**setup-verda-solo-script.sh Compatibility (CRITICAL!):**
- comfyume repo MUST match comfy-multi structure EXACTLY
- Directory: `~/comfyume/comfyui-worker/` (NOT comfyui-worker-v2!)
- Docker command unchanged: `cd ~/comfyume/comfyui-worker/ && docker compose up -d worker-1`
- Service name: `worker-1` (unchanged)
- Image name: `comfyui-worker` (keep same as comfy-multi)
- Symlinks: data/models, data/outputs, data/inputs (script creates these)
- Script changes: ONLY path updates (`/home/dev/comfy-multi` → `/home/dev/comfyume`)
- Added constraint comments to Issue #2 (Dockerfile) and Issue #5 (docker-compose)

**Worker API Stability (Reinforced):**
- worker.py needs MINIMAL changes (just VRAM monitoring)
- All ComfyUI endpoints stable: /prompt, /queue, /ws, /history
- This significantly reduces Verda Team's work (2-3h total)

**Clear Dependencies:**
- VRAM monitoring (Issue #4) has no dependencies - can start NOW
- worker.py (Issue #3) depends on VRAM monitoring
- Dockerfile (Issue #2) depends on worker.py
- Testing (Issue #6) depends on all previous issues

### Files Modified
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added critical implementation principle
- `progress-verda-dev.md` - Updated with Session Verda 02

### Commits
**Repo: comfy-multi**
- Branch: `verda-track`
- `4229c25` - docs: add critical implementation principle - backup & copy, don't rewrite

### Next Steps

**Verda Team (Us) - Ready to Start:**
1. Begin Issue #4 (VRAM monitoring) - no blockers
2. Continue to Issue #3 (worker.py integration)
3. Continue to Issue #2 (Dockerfile build)
4. Complete Issue #5 (timeout configuration)
5. Deploy to Verda H100 and test (Issue #6)

**Mello Team - In Progress:**
- Creating detailed issues for frontend/extensions/workflows (#2-9)
- Working in parallel on their track

**Integration - After Both Complete:**
- Phase 3: Testing issues (#15-19)
- End-to-end validation
- Workshop readiness verification
