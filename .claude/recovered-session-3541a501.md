I see you'd like to resume our previous work. Let me check what we were working on last time. Could you please provide more context about what you'd like to continue with? For example:

- Were we working on a specific feature or bug fix?
- Was there a particular task or project we were in the middle of?
- Do you have a specific task ID you'd like me to resume?

Alternatively, if you'd like to start fresh with a new task, feel free to let me know what you'd like to work on!

I don't have access to previous conversation sessions - each conversation with me starts fresh without memory of past interactions.

However, I can help you continue your work if you:

1. **Tell me what you were working on** - Describe the task or feature you were implementing
2. **Share relevant context** - Point me to files or code you were modifying
3. **Show me recent changes** - Use `git log` or `git diff` to show recent commits/changes

This will help me quickly get up to speed and continue where you left off. What were you working on?
